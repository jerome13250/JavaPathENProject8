Gradle File paths : https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/working_with_files.html#sec:single_file_paths
What happens in the case of multi-project builds? The file() method will always turn relative paths into paths that are relative
to the current project directory, which may be a child project. If you want to use a path that’s relative to the root project
directory, then you need to use the special Project.getRootDir() property to construct an absolute path, like so:
       File configFile = file("$rootDir/shared/config.xml")
